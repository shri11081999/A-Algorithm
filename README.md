## üöÄ Introduction

The **A* algorithm** is a search algorithm used to find the shortest path between the start and goal nodes in a graph. It combines features of **Dijkstra's Algorithm** and **Greedy Best-First Search** to efficiently find the optimal path. The algorithm is widely used in various applications, such as navigation systems and games, due to its balance of efficiency and accuracy.

A* is both **optimal** (it guarantees finding the shortest path) and **complete** (it explores all possible paths). These characteristics make it one of the most popular techniques for pathfinding and graph traversal.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to find the shortest path across an 8x8 chessboard-like grid using the A* algorithm. The grid contains barriers (obstacles) that the path must avoid while minimizing the total cost. The movement is allowed in any direction, including diagonally, similar to the movement of a King in chess.

### Grid Description:
- **Start Position**: (0, 0)
- **End Position**: (7, 7)
- **Obstacles**: Predefined positions with a movement cost of 100.
- **Movement**: One square in any direction (up, down, left, right, diagonally).

### Objective:
Find the lowest cost path from the start position to the goal position while avoiding obstacles. The path should be optimal in terms of the total cost.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a simulated 8x8 grid, similar to a chessboard, with barriers representing obstacles. The goal is to find the shortest path from the start position `(0, 0)` to the end position `(7, 7)` while avoiding the obstacles.

### Grid Description:
- **Start Position**: (0, 0)
- **End Position**: (7, 7)
- **Movement**: Allowed in all directions, similar to a King's movement in chess.
- **Obstacles**: Several grid cells represent barriers with high movement costs.

## üìê Algorithm Overview

### Key Concepts:
- **g (cost)**: The cost of moving from the start node to the current node.
- **h (heuristic)**: The estimated cost from the current node to the goal node.
- **f (total cost)**: Calculated as `f = g + h`, it guides the search to prioritize nodes with the lowest estimated total cost.

The algorithm evaluates the neighboring nodes of the current node, calculates their `f` values, and moves to the node with the lowest `f` value. This process continues until the goal node is reached.

## üîÑ Flowchart

The A* algorithm operates by continuously selecting the node with the lowest `f` value and exploring its neighbors until the goal is reached.

## üîç Heuristics

The A* algorithm uses heuristics to estimate the cost to reach the goal. The common heuristics used are:

1. **Manhattan Distance**: Used when movement is allowed only in four directions (up, down, left, right).
2. **Diagonal Distance**: Used when diagonal movements are allowed (similar to a King in chess).
3. **Euclidean Distance**: Used when movement is allowed in any direction.

## üéÆ Pygame Visualization

This project includes a **Pygame-based visualization** that demonstrates the A* algorithm in action. The visualization shows the algorithm finding the shortest path on an 8x8 grid with obstacles. The visualization highlights the following elements:

- **Black Squares**: Obstacles
- **Orange Square**: Start Node
- **Blue Square**: Goal Node
- **Purple Squares**: Shortest Path

## üëç Pros and Cons of A* Algorithm

### Pros:
- **Versatility**: Can be adapted to simulate other algorithms like Dijkstra's by adjusting heuristics.
- **Optimal**: Guarantees finding the least cost path if one exists.
- **Complete**: Explores all possible paths ensuring all options are considered.

### Cons:
- **Multiple Targets**: Less efficient when there are multiple target nodes, as it needs to be run multiple times.
